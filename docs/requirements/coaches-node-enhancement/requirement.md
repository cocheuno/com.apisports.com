# Coaches Node

## Overview
Implementation of Coaches node for querying coaches data from the API-Sports Football API.

## Priority
- [ ] Critical (blocking work)
- [ ] High (important enhancement)
- [x] Medium (nice to have)
- [ ] Low (future consideration)

## Status
- [x] JSON Response Examples Available
- [ ] Requirements Defined
- [ ] Implementation Started
- [ ] Implementation Completed
- [ ] Tested

## Available JSON Examples

The following API response examples are available in this directory:

- `coaches-response.json`

## Next Steps

1. Review JSON response structures
2. Define node requirements and output schema
3. Determine query parameters and filter options
4. Design node dialog UI
5. Implement NodeModel, NodeDialog, and NodeFactory
6. Add tests
7. Update documentation

## API Documentation

- API-Sports Football API: https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3

## Notes

- JSON response examples provided for reference
- Final implementation will follow existing node patterns (Fixtures, Teams, Players)
- Should support composable architecture (Selector + Details pattern where applicable)
