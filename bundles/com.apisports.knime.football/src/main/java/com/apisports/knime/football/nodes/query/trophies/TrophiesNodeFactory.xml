        <intro>
            <p>Queries trophies for players or coaches from the Football API.</p>
            <p>This node accepts output from either a Players or Coaches node and automatically
            queries trophies for all individuals in the input table. The node detects whether
            the input is from a Players or Coaches node by checking for Player_ID or Coach_ID
            columns and uses the appropriate API parameter.</p>
            <p><b>Usage:</b> Connect a Players or Coaches node to the third input port. The node
            will process all players/coaches from the input and return their trophy history.</p>
            <p><b>Output:</b> Each row represents one trophy won by a player or coach, including
            the league, country, season, and placement (e.g., "Winner", "2nd Place").</p>
